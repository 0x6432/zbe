# Zig-native rewrite handoff

## Scope and base

- Branch: `rewrite/zig-native`, based on `ab50bae01ee280b836bd86f2a8d23866912f19bc`.
- This is an independent, from-scratch core under `rewrite/`, not a completed compiler rewrite.
- Legacy compiler sources, root build configuration, reference tools and regression tests are unchanged.
- `main` and `wip/idiomatic` remain at the base; publish only this rewrite branch. No release or tag is authorized.

## Implemented foundation

Allocator-owned symbols, separately allocated module-owned functions, typed function-scoped block/value IDs, tagged scalar constants/operands, minimal binary instructions and terminators, structural/type validation with bidirectional definition checks. No legacy imports, mutable compiler globals or libc dependency in the new core.

Tests cover owned string input, deduplication, stable borrowed symbol strings/function pointers, independent modules, typed builders, invalid operands/targets/returns, corrupt definition links, growth, low-word branch conditions, and cleanup under every allocation failure in representative growth scenarios. Dedicated recovery tests inject failure at both linked builder allocations, then retry on the same function.

The validator is not a full SSA verifier; IDs do not encode their owner identity. No parser, complete IL vocabulary, CFG/dominance engine, optimizer, target lowering, register allocation, emitter or CLI is implemented yet. Do not claim backend or ABI compatibility from these foundation tests.

## Verification and publication

Use the pinned Zig version from README. Run `zig build test` in Debug, ReleaseSafe and ReleaseFast plus `zig fmt --check build.zig src`. The branch-only workflow `.github/workflows/rewrite.yml` tests those same three modes; it does not assert legacy compiler parity or publish releases.

Local verification results and remote run status are recorded below after completion.

## Next milestone

Implement source spans, typed diagnostics and a new lexer/parser, followed by full typed IL and CFG/SSA verification. See DESIGN.md for the complete acceptance roadmap. Do not delegate parsing or code generation to the legacy implementation and describe that as a rewrite.

### Local foundation verification

Pinned Zig `0.18.0-dev.35+5e754304d`: **13/13 tests passed in each of Debug, ReleaseSafe and ReleaseFast**. Formatting passed. The allocation-failure scenarios and same-function recovery checks are included in all three runs. Verification log in the working environment: `/data/verify-native-rewrite-foundation.log` (not a portable repository artifact).

`git diff origin/main -- src build.zig build.zig.zon tools tests` was empty. The old compiler suite was not rerun for this isolated foundation; its earlier CI result is not evidence of rewrite parity.

### Published foundation CI

Published source checkpoint: `fa8ec8fb54a3bca64d3fdcc1708b64cfcc8b7d98` on `rewrite/zig-native`.

GitHub run https://github.com/0x6432/zbe/actions/runs/38860532445 completed with **success**: Foundation (Debug), Foundation (ReleaseSafe), and Foundation (ReleaseFast) all passed. This is the independent foundation workflow, not the legacy nine-job compatibility suite.

Remote `main` and `wip/idiomatic` were confirmed at `ab50bae01ee280b836bd86f2a8d23866912f19bc` after the branch push. No tag or release was created. This result-recording follow-up is documentation-only; it does not change the tested source or workflow.
